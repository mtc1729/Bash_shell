To execute the shell
gcc -o main_file main_file.c
./main_file

All basic shell command supported

Caveat :
1.Since background redirects the control to /dev/null closing standard input , history command does not display the commands followed by &.
2. ls -l | sort is printing the prompt dialogue New_shell~$:$ but the prompt returns back. So even though its blank , one can type a command
and execute it. However this problem does'nt occur with other commands.

Unjustified combinations are as follows :
1. Input-output redirection followed by pipe i.e. wc -l < input.txt | sort
2. Output followed by input operator : i.e. ls -l > out.txt < in.txt
3. <command> | | | is invalid

Up and down arrow key works by pressing up arrow followed by enter and pressing down arrow followed by enter to display the history in top or down fashion
